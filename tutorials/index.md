# Tutorials
This collection of tutorials will guide you through the features and capabilities of the `sgptools` library. You will learn how to model a variety of sensor placement and informative path planning problems, from basic setups to more advanced, real-world scenarios.

We include tutorials for the following:

* **Informative Path Planning:** This tutorial covers various Informative Path Planning (IPP) scenarios using the `sgptools` library. It starts with a basic setup and then explores single-robot and multi-robot IPP with different sensor configurations.

**Adaptive Informative Path Planning:** This tutorial demonstrates Adaptive Informative Path Planning (AIPP), where a robot can update its understanding of the environment and re-plan its path on the fly as it gathers new data.

* **Non-Stationary Kernels:** This tutorial walks you through using non-stationary kernels within the `sgptools` library. It compares the performance of a `Neural Kernel`, an `Attentive Kernel`, and a standard `RBF Kernel` on a sensor placement task.
