# SGP-based Optimization Tools
Software Suite for [Sensor Placement](https://itskalvik.com/publication/sgp-sp) (SP) and [Informative Path Planning](https://itskalvik.com/publication/sgp-ipp) (IPP). 

The library includes python code for the following:
- Greedy algorithm-based approaches
- Bayesian optimization-based approaches
- Genetic algorithm-based approaches
- Sparse Gaussian process (SGP)-based approaches

- The [ros_sgp_tools](https://github.com/itskalvik/ros_sgp_tools) package provides a ROS2 companion package for SGP-Tools that can be deployed on ArduPilot-based vehicles. 
- The [docker-sgp-tools](https://github.com/itskalvik/docker-sgp-tools) package provides docker containers for running SGP-Tools in simulation and on ArduPilot-based vehicles.

## Installation
The library is available as a ```pip``` package. To install the package, run the following command:

```
python3 -m pip install sgptools
```

Installation from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/itskalvik/sgp-tools.git
cd sgp-tools/
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Note: The requirements.txt file contains packages and their latest versions that were verified to be working without any issues.
