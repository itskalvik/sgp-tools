"""Special non-stationary kernel functions in this package:

- `neural_kernel`: Provides the neural spectral kernel that uses a mixture of multilayer perceptrons
- `attentive_kernel`: Provides the attentive kernel that uses a multilayer perceptron to get a mixture of RBF kernels 
- `neural_network`: Helper class that provides a multilayer perceptron compatible with GPFlow
