SGP-Tools is a software suite for [Sensor Placement](https://itskalvik.com/publication/sgp-sp) and [Informative Path Planning](https://itskalvik.com/publication/sgp-ipp).

The library includes python code for the following:

- Greedy algorithm-based approaches
- Bayesian optimization-based approaches
- Genetic algorithm-based approaches
- Sparse Gaussian process (SGP)-based approaches
