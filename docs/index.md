## Why SGP-Tools?

-   **State-of-the-Art Algorithms**: Includes a variety of optimization methods including greedy algorithms, Bayesian optimization, CMA-ES, and SGP-based optimization.
-   **Advanced Modeling Capabilities**: Go beyond simple point sensing with tools for informative path planning for multi-robot systems and complex sensor field-of-view (FoV) models.
-   **Non-Stationary Kernels**: Capture complex, real-world phenomena with specialized non-stationary kernels like the Neural Spectral Kernel and the Attentive Kernel.
-   **Flexible and Extensible**: Built on GPflow and TensorFlow, the library is designed to be modular and easy to extend with your own custom methods, kernels, and objectives.
