SGP-Tools is a software suite for [Sensor Placement](https://itskalvik.com/publication/sgp-sp) and [Informative Path Planning](https://itskalvik.com/publication/sgp-ipp).

The library includes python code for the following:

- Greedy algorithm-based approaches
- Bayesian optimization-based approaches
- Genetic algorithm-based approaches
- Sparse Gaussian process (SGP)-based approaches

## Installation
The library is available as a ```pip``` package. To install the package, run the following command:

```
python3 -m pip install sgptools
```

Installation from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/itskalvik/sgp-tools.git
cd sgp-tools/
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

Note: The requirements.txt file contains packages and their latest versions that were last verified to be working without any issues.

## Quick Start
Please refer to the [example Jupyter notebooks](examples/IPP.html) demonstrating the methods included in the library ðŸ˜„
